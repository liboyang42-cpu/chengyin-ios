# Native iOS migration progress

Status: migration in progress, not release-ready.

## Working convention

Continue implementation and validation on `migration/native-ios`. Do not open a new PR for every small slice. Open one overall migration PR when the complete scope is implemented and its acceptance evidence is available. Earlier small draft PRs remain historical evidence; closing them does not mean their features are complete or merged into main. The migration branch preserves their commits.

[Native checks run 36842060624](https://github.com/liboyang42-cpu/chengyin-ios/actions/runs/36842060624)

- 69 Swift unit tests passed
- 6 Python importer tests passed
- 5 iPhone Simulator UI tests passed
- Unsigned simulator Debug and device Release builds passed
- Gitleaks passed

The five UI cases cover persisted language switching, repeated player/merchant entry dismissal, unconfigured login blocking, repeated Settings presentation after cold launch, and the scanner's unsupported-Simulator/Cancel path. They do not exercise real credentials, business data, camera recognition or payment.

## Implemented, with limits

- Independent SwiftUI project with iOS17 provisional minimum; English/Chinese resource catalogs and app language preference
- Existing-account password sign-in code, Keychain session storage, bootstrap/logout/cancellation guards; live server and physical Keychain behavior unverified
- Read-only activity client, searchable/paged native list, detail, ticket display, MapKit for valid coordinates and explicit club gate; these activity screens still need their own UI fixtures/screenshots and backend validation
- Registration request/response contracts, quote signature preservation and stable retry identifiers; no order/payment execution
- VisionKit/UIKit scanner component, permission/lifecycle/retry/one-shot-delivery handling; outside production navigation pending a validated business host, and physical-device recognition untested
- Reviewed-key ARB conversion tool; candidate resource conversion is not completed UI translation

## Not yet completed

New-account registration; native Apple/WeChat provider flows; the full original home and primary navigation; roam and game/check-in loops; registration/quote/order/payment/ticket verification/refund UI; merchant and club workflows; messaging/collaboration; remaining source features; full content localization; accessibility/visual/device acceptance; signing and distribution.

No migration percentage is claimed. Source route declarations, resource keys, test counts and compiled files are different measures.

## Next acceptance sequence

1. Add controlled activity and session UI fixtures, screenshots and lifecycle regression coverage
2. Complete a discover → detail → quote → registration/order-status vertical slice with explicit confirmation and authoritative status readback
3. Migrate remaining player, merchant, club and messaging workflows against source contracts
4. Validate using an approved non-production API and purpose-built accounts/data; do not use production data as disposable tests
5. Complete device, privacy/legal, accessibility, asset-license and release checks; release/signing/production changes require separate authorization

## Known verification history

An earlier UI run failed because the test queried a native Picker option as StaticText; another inherited a Picker identifier onto its children. Tests now use the observed native Button labels. A later run lost a synthesized Settings tap; readiness/post-navigation checks and repeated cold-launch coverage were added. One rerun also encountered Xcode simulator launch/DTX failures. These failures remain recorded; subsequent green runs do not erase them or prove universal runtime reliability.
